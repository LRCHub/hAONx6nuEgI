Aint't no man of higher education
I am nothing in the way of a wit
Ain't no poster child for the age of information
But I know a good thing when I see it
I know a good thing

Ain't too big on old time religion
I keep the faith the way I see fit
Indeed some might say I'm a man gone to perdition
Maybe so, but I know a good thing when I see it
I know a good thing
Yeahhhh

Don't need no weatherman to tell me when
The sun is shining
No GPS, no gyrocompass, best guess west
Is where it sets tonight
Don't need no dotted line, no print too fine
I'm more of the mind
To read the man, shake his hand,
Let the cards land where they might
I know a good thing
Yeahhh
A good thing yeah
I know a good thing

Don't need no dotted line, no print too fine
I'm more of the mind
To read the man, shake his hand,
Let the cards land where they might
I know a good thing
Yeahhh
A good thing yeah
I know a good thing

She got eyes like sapphire diamonds
A set of legs that just won't quit
I Didn't quite get her name but I hear wedding bells chimin'
Cause I know a good thing when I see it
I know a good thing
