My baby came home late last night
I said, "Girl, I gotta talk to you
I've been drinkin' with the man next door
He said he's been singin' with you
Whoever's tellin' lies it's time to say bye, bye
You know my mama didn't raise no fool"

You're gonna walk out that door
You'll never see me anymore
Tell you what I'm gonna do, yeah

I'm gonna love ya' just one more time
Love to see what you've got
I don't care if it takes all night
Gonna make you remember for the rest of your life, oh, baby

We had a good thing, a good thing goin'
But ain't been seein' eye to eye
You had a good thing, it's all over
Might as well wave and say goodbye

It's easy to see the guilt in your eyes
Girl, I want you to tell me the truth
Was he worth the risk and all the trouble he's caused
Now it comes down to me and you?
You thought I was blind when you were gone all the time
Playin' me for a fool

You're gonna walk out that door
You'll never see me anymore
Tell you what I'm gonna do, yeah

I'm gonna love ya' just one more time
Love to see what you've got
I don't care if it takes all night
Gonna make you remember for the rest of your life, oh, baby

We had a good thing, a good thing goin'
But ain't been seein' eye to eye
You had a good thing, it's all over
We had a good thing, a good thing goin'
Might as well wave and say goodbye
Good thing, a good thing goin'

(Good thing)
We had a good thing goin' baby, but it's all over
(Good thing)
We had a good thing goin', we had a good thing goin' baby
A good thing goin' on, oh, goin on

Good thing, good thing goin', good thing
Good thing, good thing goin', good thing
Good thing, good thing goin', good thing
Good thing, good thing goin', good thing
Good thing, good thing goin', good thing

Good thing, good thing goin', good thing
Good thing, good thing goin', good thing
Good thing, good thing goin', good thing
Good thing, good thing goin'
